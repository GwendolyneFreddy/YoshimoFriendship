# YoshimoFriendship
This mod adds a series of dialogues with Yoshimo, our favourite charming knave whom we meet in Irenicus Chateau at the beginning of the game. Spanning the length of the time he's in the party, the Yoshimo Friendship expands on the humorous rogue, adding to his story and giving the player a new perspective on the character.
